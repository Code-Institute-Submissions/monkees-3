 This website has been made for 60s band "The Monkees" using HTML5 and CSS with Bootstrap templates.
 The purpose of this site is for new and existing fans of the band to have a place to find all of The Monkees content,
 whilst also directing those fans towards The Monkees' social media.
 
 This project was deployed using the c9 ide and tested manually.
 
 I copied some existing code from external sources, namely the css for  the .videoWrapper class and
 .videoWrapper iFrame styling. This code was used for fluid resizing of the videos on the video.html page. (1)
 The styling for the horizontal rule on about.html is also from an external source (class name .style-one) I kept this code unchanged
 as I felt that the style fit the overall feel of the page well. (2)
