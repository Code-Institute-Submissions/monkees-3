# The Monkees 

This website has been made for 60s band "The Monkees" using HTML5 and CSS with Bootstrap frameworks.
The purpose of this site is for new and existing fans of the band to have a place to find all of The Monkees content,
whilst also directing those fans towards The Monkees' social media.

## Features

* About page -  Page describing all of The Monkees history and albums
* Music Page - A page for users to listen to .mp3 files of The Monkees music
* Videos Page - A Page for users to watch official The Monkees 
* Contacts Page - For users to contact the band to organise gigs or events.
* Social Media links - To direct users towards the bands social media.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5/CSS
* Bootstrap for the grid system and default styles
* Font awesome for social media icons


## Testing

#### All Pages

* Checked for mobile friendly reorganising of content and made sure everything is displayed as intended
* Checked the hover state of all links
* Checked the links redirect to where they are meant to.
* Opened/closed the sign up modal

The sign up modal's "Submit" button and the booking page's "submit" button currently do not do anything.
This is because the project was a static front end website. This is not a bug.
 
## Deployment

This project was deployed on github pages.

 
 
 ### Credit
 
 I copied some existing code from external sources, namely the css for  the .videoWrapper class and
 .videoWrapper iFrame styling. This code was used for fluid resizing of the videos on the video.html page. (1)
 The styling for the horizontal rule on about.html is also from an external source (class name .style-one) I kept this code unchanged
 as I felt that the style fit the overall feel of the page well. (2)
